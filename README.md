# GifTastic

### Overview

This project served to demonstrate an ability to work with API calls. It features some pre-generated buttons with animals names that, when clicked, display 10 GIFs from GIPHY using the label of the button as the search query. 

GIFs initially appear paused and clicking induces a play or pause functionality. The rating of each gif is displayed below it. By clicking the plus button at the bottom of a group of generated GIFs, the user can load ten additional GIFs using that search query. Hovering over individual GIFs shows a download button, allowing the user to access the original GIF file.

Users can also add buttons of their own using the form on the right. When applicable search terms are selected (currently dog, cat, horse, or bird), an additional form appears on the right where users can input their zip code and see adoptable pets of that type in their area.
